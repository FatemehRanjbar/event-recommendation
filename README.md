This project proposes an integrated recommendation model for Event-Based Social Networks (EBSNs), aiming to enhance user participation and engagement through highly personalized and context-aware event recommendations. EBSNs differ from traditional social networks by allowing users to interact both online and offline around events.

The proposed system combines semantic enrichment, user preference modeling, and event flow controllability to recommend events that align with users' interests, social connections, and behavioral context. The goal is to help users discover relevant events while also enabling platforms to better understand and manage event dynamics.

Overall Topic:
Improve engagement on social networks for highly personalized and contextually relevant suggested events.
Achieve a set of algorithms that ultimately lead to improved social network engagement on events.
Develop personalized and context-aware events through the utilization of the developed algorithms.
